# Silent Node.js Server Failure
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Node.js where a server might fail to start without providing any informative error messages.  The lack of error output makes debugging difficult.

## Problem
The provided `server.js` contains a basic Express.js server.  Under normal circumstances, it should start and listen on port 3000. However, in certain scenarios, such as port conflicts or underlying system issues, the server might fail silently, leaving the developer clueless about the cause of the failure.

## Solution
The `serverSolution.js` file offers a solution by implementing proper error handling using a `try...catch` block around the `app.listen()` call and also using a process.on('uncaughtException') block.  This ensures that any errors during server startup are caught and logged to the console, aiding in debugging.
